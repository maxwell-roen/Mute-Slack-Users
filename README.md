# Mute-Slack-Users
A (very) hastily thrown together Chrome extension to effectively "mute" users on slack.
For those unfortunate times when you find yourself in a slack group with some intolerant individuals. Or whatever.

Does the trick well enough. You will occasionally see flashes when new messages from muted users are pulled down
from the server in between my scripts ticks. If at some point I decide this is irritating, I might get around to figuring
out how to block content from those users ever being pulled down.

How to use?

1) Add users to config.js in a comma separated list.
  eg: "user1", "user2", "user3"
2) Navigate to chrome://extensions
3) Drag and drop the entire file onto the extensions page
